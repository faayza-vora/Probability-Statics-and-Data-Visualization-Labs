It aims to seperate an image into two classes named foreground and background by finding an optimal threshold value based on the histogram pixel intensities.\n","\n","In this lab we implemented Otsu's Bonarosation algorithm and evaluated its performance on a greyscale image. Gaussian noise was added to the input image\n","\n","It helped me to understand the concept of image thresholding. I learnt about Otsu's binarization, its underlying mathematics and its implementation using python and open CV. I could also evaluate the effect of noise on image processing algorithm\n","\n","##Image thresholding\n","It refers to a technique which is used to seperate region of interest from background by converting it into a binary image. This is done by using otsu's binarizatio as stated above\n","\n","##Gaussian noise\n","It is a type of noise which follows gaissian or normal distribution. It is commonly encountered in digital images and can degrade image quality. In order to generate gaussian noise i have used np.random.normal function\n","\n","##Between-class Variance\n","Between-class variance is a measure of the spread between the mean values of different classes in an image histogram. It quantifies the separation between foreground and background classes and is maximized by Otsu's Binarization to find the optimal threshold.\n","\n","##In-class Variance\n","In-class variance measures the spread of pixel intensities within each class (foreground and background). Minimizing in-class variance ensures that each class is internally homogeneous after thresholding which in turn ensures optimal calculation of threshold.\n","\n","##Formula\n","Otsu's Method: Otsu's method calculates the optimal threshold value\n","threshold\n","threshold by maximizing the between-class variance $\\sigma_{b}^{2}$  is defined as:\n","\\begin{equation}\n","     \\sigma_{b}^{2} = w_{0} \\times w_{1} \\times (\\mu_{0} - \\mu_{1}) ^{2}\n","\\end{equation}\n","where $w_{0}$ and $w_{1}$ are the probabilities of the two classes (foreground and background) separated by the threshold and $\\mu_{0}$ and $\\mu_{1}$ are the mean intensities of the two classes.\n","\n","##Observations\n","1.
